=======================

``mc2err`` is an open-source C library for computing standardized error bars for Markov-chain data.
It is presently in its third design and attempt at implementation, now using coarse-grained hypothesis
testing instead of maximum likelihood estimation to avoid Markov-chain modeling assumptions.

An early, unfinished version of this library was presented at the 2021 APS March Meeting, and a complete
redesign and second attempt at implementation followed shortly after that.

The first full release is planned for early 2024 with a minimal feature set, and future versions with
expanded functionality will depend on user feedback.
