=======================

``mc2err`` is an open-source C library for computing standardized error bars for Markov-chain data.
This is a beta version that is presently undergoing testing of the core features as a paper is prepared
for describing the proposed standard for error bars. An early version of this library was presented
at the 2021 APS March Meeting, but it has since been completely redesigned and rewritten.

Once the core functionality is working, OpenMP and MPI support will be added, and interfaces will be
provided for use with popular scientific programming languages.
